# Changelog

All notable changes to Ternak TT are recorded here. The GitHub Actions workflow
reads the matching `## vX.Y.Z` section to build `release_notes.md` automatically
on every release.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## v1.0.15

### Added

- **Runtime whitelist `target.txt`** at `/data/adb/modules/ternak_tt/target.txt`. Add / remove target packages without rebuilding.
- Companion loads and **hot-reloads** `target.txt` on mtime change (next app spawn picks up edits).
- New CLI subcommand `ternak-tt targets` to dump the active whitelist.
- L7 `SUPPRESS` label for known log-noise keys (`log.looper.*.slow`, `debug.watson.*`) to keep summaries readable.
- `summarize.sh` now breaks SPOOF hits out by hook layer (`L1` / `L2` / `L7-SPB` / `L7-SPI` / `L7-SPL`) and counts `SUPPRESS`, `REJECT`, `ACCEPT` separately.
- `customize.sh` **preserves** existing `target.txt` across reinstalls.

### Changed

- Zygisk companion IPC protocol for `CMD_GET_IDENTITY` now includes the pkg name; companion responds with `len=0` for non-targets (single source of truth for whitelist).
- Zygisk `.so` no longer contains a hardcoded target list.
- `ternak-tt.cpp` `wipe_tt_data()` reads targets from `target.txt` for symmetry with the Zygisk side.

### Fixed

- Whitelist drift between the CLI (`ternak-tt`) and Zygisk companion — both now share one file.

---

## v1.0.14

### Added

- `post-fs-data.sh` + new `ternak-tt seed` subcommand that generates identity + mount overlay files **before** Zygisk loads, fixing the first-boot race where the first TT/Grab pid got 0/6 bind mounts.
- Android 11+ canonical partition paths in `BIND_ENTRIES` (`/odm/etc/build.prop`, `/product/etc/build.prop`, `/system_ext/etc/build.prop`) alongside the legacy paths.
- Skip counter is split into `skip_src` (module bug) vs `skip_dst` (device doesn't have that partition — expected).

### Fixed

- 3-skip on POCO F3 / MIUI-style ROMs where partition build.prop lives at `/<part>/etc/build.prop`.

---

## v1.0.13

### Added

- **Per-type L7 spoof maps** (`tt_bool_spoof`, `tt_int_spoof`, `tt_long_spoof`) consulted by the typed `native_get_*` hooks before falling back to `def`.
- Critical spoof: `sys.boot_completed = true` (previously returned `false`, breaking app boot-detection retry loops).
- L2 `debug.force_rtl` → `false`.

### Fixed

- 800+ hot L7 leaks from v1.0.12 telemetry (`sys.boot_completed`, `debug.sqlite.*`, `build.version.extensions.*`, `ro.gfx.driver_build_time`, `dalvik.vm.dexopt.secondary`, etc.).

---

## v1.0.12

### Added

- Crash watchdog rewrite: 4 signals (`SIGABRT` / `SIGFPE` / `SIGILL` / `SIGSYS`), rate-limited 3 per signal, restores `SIG_DFL` (no signal chaining).
- 18 additional L2 `native_get` spoofs (`gsm.*`, `sys.boot_completed`, `cpu.abi*`, `dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit`, `ro.build.characteristics`, `persist.sys.timezone`, `ro.mediacodec.*`).

### Fixed

- YAML workflow version resolution (was overwriting `module.prop` with git-describe fallback `v0.0.6`).
- `summarize.sh` MOUNT regex missing the new companion log format.

---

## v1.0.11

### Added

- Standalone `summarize.sh` that condenses a 7 MB session log into a ~10 KB chat-shareable summary.
- Action tap on debug variant now auto-produces `summary-<ts>.txt`, copies `crashes.log`, and gzips the raw log to `/sdcard/Download/ternak-tt-logs/`.
- Automatic pruning: keeps newest 10 summaries / crashes / raw.gz per install.

---

## v1.0.10

### Added

- **Zero-setup auto-log capture** on debug variant. `service.sh` starts a background logcat on boot into `/data/adb/modules/ternak_tt/debug/session-<ts>.log`, keeping the 5 newest sessions.
- Session header written to each log (module version, boot time, uptime, Android SDK, device, ABI, installed root modules).

---

## v1.0.9

### Added

- Detailed `[D]` traces for every hook layer (which key was queried, what was returned, LEAK vs SPOOF vs MISS labelling).
- Companion mount timeline traces (`setns OK`, per-bind check, ok/fail/skip breakdown).
- Crash / death / leak journal that persists across reboots.

---

## v1.0.8

### Added

- Debug variant build alongside release. Both variants are produced by `build.sh` per invocation.
- `TT_DEBUG` compile-time flag: release strips `LOGD` calls entirely (zero cost), debug keeps them.

---

## v1.0.7

### Added

- Expanded target set to include Grab Passenger (`com.grabtaxi.passenger`) — driver/passenger apps do heavy device fingerprinting for fraud.

---

## v1.0.6

### Fixed

- Bind-mount `EINVAL` in the Zygisk-Next companion. Companion now forks a single-threaded child that `setns`es into the target's mount namespace before mounting.

---

## v1.0.5

### Added

- Zygisk companion process serving `CMD_GET_IDENTITY` and `CMD_DO_MOUNTS` over the built-in Zygisk UDS.

---

## v1.0.4

### Fixed

- `EACCES` on `mount()` from `preAppSpecialize` (CAP_SYS_ADMIN dropped). Mounting is now handled by the companion, which retains caps.

---

## v1.0.3

### Added

- Bind-mount overlay tree at `$MODPATH/mount/{system,vendor,odm,product,system_ext}/build.prop` + `settings_secure.xml`.
- `ternak-tt freshen` regenerates all overlay files.

---

## v1.0.2

### Added

- `resetprop-rs` invocation from `apply-boot` and `freshen` to broadcast native property changes.

---

## v1.0.1

### Added

- Standalone CLI (`ternak-tt`) with `freshen`, `status`, `rollback`, `lock`, `unlock`, `apply-boot` subcommands.

---

## v1.0.0

Initial release.

- 6-layer Java hook: `Build.*`, `SystemProperties.native_get`, `Settings.Secure.getString`, `AdvertisingIdClient.Info.getId` (stub), `WifiInfo.getMacAddress` / `getBSSID`, `TelephonyManager.getImei` / `getDeviceId` / `getSubscriberId` / `getMeid`.
- Pixel-only device pool (SDK 33–36).
- TikTok Global / Asia / Lite target packages.
